# Decision Trees

## Overview
Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression. The model predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

### Where is it Used?
- **Customer segmentation:** Identifying customer groups based on purchasing behavior.
- **Risk assessment:** Determining loan approval based on financial metrics.
- **Medical diagnosis:** Classifying diseases based on patient symptoms.

## How Does it Work?
A Decision Tree is built by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features. This process is repeated recursively, creating branches that eventually lead to decisions or predictions. The splitting is based on metrics like Gini impurity or Information Gain.
