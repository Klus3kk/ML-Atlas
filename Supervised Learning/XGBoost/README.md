# XGBoost

## Overview
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It has become one of the most popular algorithms in machine learning competitions.

### Where is it Used?
- **Kaggle competitions:** Frequently used in winning solutions.
- **Forecasting:** Predicting time series data.
- **Healthcare:** Predicting patient outcomes.

## How Does it Work?
XGBoost builds upon the idea of gradient boosting by adding regularization to reduce overfitting, using a more efficient computation method, and being able to handle missing values internally.
