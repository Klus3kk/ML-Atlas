# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Overview
Support Vector Machines are powerful classification algorithms that work by finding the hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is often used for both classification and regression tasks.

### Where is it Used?
- **Text classification:** Categorizing emails as spam or non-spam.
- **Image recognition:** Detecting faces in images.
- **Bioinformatics:** Classifying proteins and DNA sequences.

## How Does it Work?
SVMs operate by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes. For non-linearly separable data, SVMs can use kernel functions to map the input features into higher-dimensional spaces where a hyperplane can be found.
