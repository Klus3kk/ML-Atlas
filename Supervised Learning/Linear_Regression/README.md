# Linear Regression

## Overview
Linear Regression is one of the simplest and most widely used algorithms in machine learning. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

### Where is it Used?
- **Predicting sales:** Based on factors like advertising spend.
- **House price prediction:** Based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
- **Stock price prediction:** Using historical prices and other indicators.

## How Does it Work?
Linear Regression fits a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) through the data that minimizes the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values). The equation of the line is:
\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \epsilon \]

Where:
- \( y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( x_1 \) is the independent variable.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept.
- \( \beta_1 \) is the slope.
- \( \epsilon \) is the error term.
