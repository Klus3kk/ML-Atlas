# Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

## Overview
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) are powerful ensemble algorithms that build models sequentially. Each new model corrects the errors of the previous ones, gradually improving the accuracy.

### Where is it Used?
- **Credit scoring:** Predicting the probability of a borrower defaulting.
- **Web search ranking:** Improving the relevance of search results.
- **Customer churn prediction:** Predicting which customers are likely to leave.

## How Does it Work?
GBM works by building trees one at a time, each new tree trying to correct errors made by previously trained trees. The predictions are weighted by their learning rate and added together to make the final prediction.
