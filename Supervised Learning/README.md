# Supervised Learning
## Overview
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each training example is paired with an output label. The algorithm learns to map the input data to the corresponding output, allowing it to predict the labels for new, unseen data. Supervised learning is widely used for classification and regression tasks, where the goal is to predict discrete labels or continuous values, respectively.

Supervised learning algorithms are essential in many practical applications, including spam detection, medical diagnosis, credit scoring, and more. The primary advantage of supervised learning is its ability to learn from labeled data to make accurate predictions, but it requires a significant amount of labeled data, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.
