# Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

## Overview

Local Outlier Factor (LOF) measures the local density deviation of data points compared to their neighbors. It helps in identifying anomalies based on the concept of local outliers.

## Where is it Used?

- **Outlier Detection:** Identifies anomalies in high-dimensional datasets.
- **Fraud Detection:** Detects unusual transactions or activities.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Finds deviations in various applications.

## How Does it Work?

LOF computes the density of data points relative to their neighbors. Points with significantly lower density compared to their neighbors are considered anomalies.
