# Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection

## Overview

Autoencoders are neural networks used for learning efficient representations of data. For anomaly detection, autoencoders are trained to reconstruct normal data; anomalies are detected by their reconstruction errors.

## Where is it Used?

- **Fraud Detection:** Identifies unusual patterns in financial transactions.
- **Fault Detection:** Detects anomalies in industrial systems.
- **Image Anomaly Detection:** Finds defects or unusual patterns in images.

## How Does it Work?

Autoencoders learn to compress and reconstruct data. Anomalies are identified by high reconstruction errors, as the autoencoder fails to reconstruct data points that deviate from normal patterns.
