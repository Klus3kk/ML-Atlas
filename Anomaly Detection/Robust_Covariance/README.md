# Robust Covariance

## Overview

Robust Covariance is used for anomaly detection by estimating the covariance matrix in a way that is robust to outliers. It helps in identifying data points that deviate significantly from the expected distribution.

## Where is it Used?

- **Fault Detection:** Identifies anomalies in industrial systems.
- **Outlier Detection:** Detects deviations in various datasets.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Provides robust estimates in the presence of outliers.

## How Does it Work?

Robust Covariance methods estimate the covariance matrix in a way that minimizes the impact of outliers. Data points that fall far from the estimated covariance are considered anomalies.
