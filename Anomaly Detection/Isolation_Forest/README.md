# Isolation Forest

## Overview

Isolation Forest is an anomaly detection technique that isolates anomalies instead of profiling normal data. It builds an ensemble of isolation trees to separate observations.

## Where is it Used?

- **Fraud Detection:** Identifies fraudulent transactions or behaviors.
- **Intrusion Detection:** Detects anomalies in network traffic.
- **Quality Control:** Finds defects in manufacturing processes.

## How Does it Work?

Isolation Forest isolates observations by randomly selecting features and splitting values. Anomalies are isolated more quickly, thus having shorter path lengths in the trees.
