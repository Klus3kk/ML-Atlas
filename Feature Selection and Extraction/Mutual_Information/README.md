# Mutual Information

## Overview

Mutual Information is a measure of the mutual dependence between two variables. It is used in feature selection to assess the amount of information shared between a feature and the target variable.

## Where is it Used?

- **Feature Selection:** Evaluates the relevance of features based on their mutual dependence with the target variable.
- **Data Analysis:** Helps in understanding the relationships between variables.
- **Preprocessing:** Used to select features that provide the most information about the target variable.

## How Does it Work?

Mutual Information measures the amount of information obtained about one variable through the other. Features with higher mutual information scores are considered more relevant.
