# Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

## Overview

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is a feature selection method that recursively removes the least important features based on the performance of a model. It helps in identifying the most significant features for model training.

## Where is it Used?

- **Model Simplification:** Reduces the number of features to improve model interpretability and reduce overfitting.
- **Feature Ranking:** Provides a ranking of features based on their importance to the model.
- **Preprocessing:** Often used as a preprocessing step before model training.

## How Does it Work?

RFE works by fitting the model and ranking the features based on their importance. It then removes the least important features and repeats the process until the desired number of features is reached.
