# Chi-Squared Test

## Overview

The Chi-Squared Test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between categorical features and the target variable. It is commonly used for feature selection in classification problems.

## Where is it Used?

- **Categorical Data:** Used to evaluate the independence between categorical features and the target variable.
- **Feature Selection:** Helps in selecting features that have a strong association with the target variable.
- **Preprocessing:** Often used in preprocessing steps for classification tasks.

## How Does it Work?

The Chi-Squared Test compares the observed frequencies of feature values with the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis of independence. Features with higher chi-squared scores are considered more relevant.
