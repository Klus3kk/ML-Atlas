# SelectKBest

## Overview

SelectKBest is a feature selection method that selects the top k features based on a scoring function. It helps in reducing dimensionality by keeping only the most relevant features for model training.

## Where is it Used?

- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reduces the number of features to improve model performance and reduce computational cost.
- **Feature Selection:** Provides a simple and efficient way to select a subset of features based on statistical tests.
- **Preprocessing:** Used as a preprocessing step to improve model efficiency and effectiveness.

## How Does it Work?

SelectKBest evaluates each feature based on a scoring function (e.g., chi-squared test) and selects the top k features with the highest scores.
