# Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

## Overview
Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a statistical method used to separate a multivariate signal into additive, independent components. It is often used in signal processing and data analysis for tasks like blind source separation.

### Where is it Used?
- **Blind source separation:** Separating mixed signals, such as audio sources.
- **Image processing:** Decomposing images into independent components.
- **Neuroimaging:** Analyzing brain signals (e.g., EEG, fMRI).

## How Does it Work?
ICA assumes that the observed data is a mixture of independent sources and attempts to recover the original sources by maximizing the statistical independence of the components.
