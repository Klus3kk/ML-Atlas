# k-Means Clustering

## Overview
k-Means Clustering is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into distinct clusters. Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean, which serves as a prototype of the cluster.

### Where is it Used?
- **Customer segmentation:** Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Image compression:** Reducing the number of colors in an image.
- **Anomaly detection:** Identifying unusual patterns in data.

## How Does it Work?
k-Means works by initializing 'k' centroids randomly, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, and then recalculating the centroids as the mean of all points in the cluster. This process is repeated until the centroids stabilize.
