# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the model is trained on unlabeled data. The model explores the data to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures without any predefined labels. It is widely used in clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction tasks.
