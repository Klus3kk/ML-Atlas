# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions by projecting it onto the principal components, which are the directions of maximum variance.

### Where is it Used?
- **Data visualization:** Reducing dimensions for 2D or 3D plots.
- **Noise reduction:** Removing noise from datasets by reducing dimensions.
- **Feature extraction:** Identifying the most important features in the data.

## How Does it Work?
PCA works by finding the eigenvectors (principal components) of the covariance matrix of the data, which correspond to the directions of maximum variance. The data is then projected onto these components.
