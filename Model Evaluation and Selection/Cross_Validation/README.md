# Cross-Validation

## Overview

Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent dataset. It involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets to ensure that every instance is used for both training and validation.

## Where is it Used?

- **Model Validation:** Provides an unbiased estimate of model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Helps in choosing the best hyperparameters by evaluating multiple configurations.
- **Model Comparison:** Compares different models to determine the best performer.

## How Does it Work?

In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k subsets. The model is trained on k-1 subsets and validated on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with each subset serving as the validation set once.
