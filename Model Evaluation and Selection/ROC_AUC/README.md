# ROC Curve and AUC

## Overview

The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve and AUC (Area Under the Curve) are used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, while the AUC quantifies the overall ability of the model to discriminate between positive and negative classes.

## Where is it Used?

- **Binary Classification:** Assesses the performance of models that output probabilities.
- **Model Comparison:** Compares different models based on their ROC curves and AUC scores.
- **Threshold Selection:** Helps in choosing the optimal threshold for classification.

## How Does it Work?

- **ROC Curve:** Plots True Positive Rate (TPR) vs. False Positive Rate (FPR).
- **AUC:** Measures the area under the ROC curve. An AUC of 1 indicates a perfect model, while 0.5 indicates a random model.
