# Confusion Matrix

## Overview

A confusion matrix is a performance measurement tool for classification problems. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions classified by their actual and predicted labels. It provides detailed insight into the performance of a classification model.

## Where is it Used?

- **Model Evaluation:** Provides a detailed breakdown of classification performance.
- **Error Analysis:** Helps in understanding which classes are misclassified.
- **Model Improvement:** Guides adjustments and improvements in classification models.

## How Does it Work?

The confusion matrix contains:
- **True Positives (TP)**
- **True Negatives (TN)**
- **False Positives (FP)**
- **False Negatives (FN)**

From these values, additional metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score can be derived.
