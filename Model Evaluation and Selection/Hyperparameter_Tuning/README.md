# Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization)

## Overview

Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a model to improve its performance. It can be done using techniques such as Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization.

## Where is it Used?

- **Model Optimization:** Enhances model performance by finding the best hyperparameters.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Determines the most effective hyperparameter configurations for different algorithms.
- **Performance Improvement:** Aims to improve model accuracy and generalization.

## How Does it Work?

- **Grid Search:** Exhaustively searches through a predefined set of hyperparameters.
- **Random Search:** Samples hyperparameters randomly from a predefined range.
- **Bayesian Optimization:** Uses probabilistic models to explore the hyperparameter space more efficiently.
