# Self-Supervised Learning
## Overview
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a subset of unsupervised learning where the model generates its own supervisory signals from the data, removing the need for manually labeled data. It's particularly powerful in tasks where labeled data is scarce, allowing models to pre-train on vast amounts of unlabeled data and then fine-tune on smaller labeled datasets.

Self-Supervised Learning has driven significant advancements in fields like natural language processing, computer vision, and more. By leveraging self-supervised techniques, models can learn useful representations of data that can be transferred to downstream tasks, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in many areas.
