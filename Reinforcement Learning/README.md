# Reinforcement Learning
## Overview
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions in the environment to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled data and instead relies on trial and error to discover the best strategies. The key components in RL include the agent, environment, actions, states, and rewards. RL has been widely used in various applications, from game playing to robotics and autonomous systems.
