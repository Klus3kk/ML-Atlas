# Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

## Overview
Deep Q-Networks (DQN) extend Q-Learning by using neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, making it suitable for environments with large or continuous state spaces.

## Where is it Used?
- **Atari games:** DQN is famously used in the DeepMind's Atari game AI.
- **Robotic Control:** For controlling complex robotic systems with continuous states.

## How Does it Work?
DQN uses a neural network to predict Q-values for all actions given a state. It employs techniques like experience replay and target networks to stabilize training.
