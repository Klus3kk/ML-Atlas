# Monte Carlo Methods

## Overview
Monte Carlo methods involve learning directly from episodes of experience without any assumptions about the environment’s dynamics. It’s useful when the model is unknown or too complex to model.

## Where is it Used?
- **Finance:** For option pricing and risk assessment.
- **Gaming:** For training AI to play games based on sampled experiences.

## How Does it Work?
The agent collects returns from each episode and uses them to update the value function. The value is averaged over multiple episodes to improve accuracy.
