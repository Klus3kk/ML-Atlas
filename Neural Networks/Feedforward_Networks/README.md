# Feedforward Neural Networks

## Overview

Feedforward Neural Networks are the simplest type of artificial neural network, where connections between the nodes do not form cycles. Information moves in only one directionâ€”from input nodes, through hidden nodes (if any), to output nodes.

## Where is it Used?

- **Image Classification:** For classifying images into categories.
- **Regression Tasks:** Predicting continuous values such as house prices.
- **Binary Classification:** Predicting binary outcomes like spam detection.

## How Does it Work?

The network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer, applies a weight to it, sums it up, passes it through an activation function, and sends it to the next layer.
