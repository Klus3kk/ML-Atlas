# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images. They employ convolutional layers that apply filters to the input data, enabling the model to detect local patterns like edges, textures, and shapes.

## Where is it Used?

- **Image Classification:** Identifying objects within images (e.g., cats vs. dogs).
- **Object Detection:** Locating and identifying objects within an image.
- **Image Segmentation:** Dividing an image into segments.

## How Does it Work?

CNNs consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply filters to the input, pooling layers downsample the feature maps, and fully connected layers make the final predictions.
