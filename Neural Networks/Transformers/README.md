# Transformer Networks

## Overview

Transformer Networks are a type of model architecture that rely entirely on self-attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrent layers. They have become the foundation for most state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models.

## Where is it Used?

- **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another.
- **Text Summarization:** Creating concise summaries of long documents.
- **Question Answering:** Answering questions based on a given text.

## How Does it Work?

Transformers use self-attention to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when making predictions. They consist of an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder generates the output sequence.
