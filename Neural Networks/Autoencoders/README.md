# Autoencoders

## Overview

Autoencoders are neural networks used to learn efficient representations of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or feature learning. They consist of an encoder that compresses the input and a decoder that reconstructs it.

## Where is it Used?

- **Data Compression:** Reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving important features.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying anomalies by comparing the original input with the reconstructed output.
- **Image Denoising:** Removing noise from images.

## How Does it Work?

Autoencoders consist of two main components:
1. **Encoder:** Maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation.
2. **Decoder:** Reconstructs the input data from the lower-dimensional representation.

The network is trained to minimize the difference between the original input and the reconstructed output.
