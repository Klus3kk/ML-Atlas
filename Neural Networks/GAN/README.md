# Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of neural networks used to generate new data instances that resemble the training data. They consist of two networks: a generator that creates fake data and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and fake data.

## Where is it Used?

- **Image Generation:** Creating realistic images from random noise.
- **Data Augmentation

:** Generating new training samples to improve model performance.
- **Art and Design:** Creating new art pieces or design patterns.

## How Does it Work?

GANs involve a game between two networks:
1. **Generator:** Tries to generate data that is indistinguishable from real data.
2. **Discriminator:** Tries to distinguish between real and generated data.

The generator improves by trying to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator improves by better identifying fake data.
