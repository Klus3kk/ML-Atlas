# Transformer Models

## Overview

Transformer models use self-attention mechanisms to process input data. They excel in handling sequential data and capturing dependencies across long sequences, making them highly effective for various NLP tasks.

## Where is it Used?

- **Machine Translation:** Translates text between languages.
- **Text Generation:** Generates coherent and contextually relevant text.
- **Text Summarization:** Produces concise summaries of longer texts.

## How Does it Work?

Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence, allowing the model to capture context and dependencies efficiently.
