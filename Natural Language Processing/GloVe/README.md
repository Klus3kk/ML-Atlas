# GloVe

## Overview

GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is another word embedding technique that generates dense vector representations for words by capturing the global statistical information of a corpus. It is based on matrix factorization techniques applied to word co-occurrence matrices.

## Where is it Used?

- **Semantic Analysis:** Provides dense representations capturing word meanings.
- **Text Classification:** Improves the performance of text classification tasks.
- **Information Retrieval:** Enhances the relevance of search results.

## How Does it Work?

GloVe constructs a word-word co-occurrence matrix from a corpus and factorizes it to obtain word vectors that capture the relationships between words.
