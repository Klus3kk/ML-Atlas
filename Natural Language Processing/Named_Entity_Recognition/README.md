# Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an NLP task that involves identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., people, organizations, locations) within text. It helps in extracting structured information from unstructured text.

## Where is it Used?

- **Information Extraction:** Identifies key entities in documents for structured data extraction.
- **Search Engines:** Enhances search functionalities by recognizing entities.
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Builds relationships between identified entities for better information retrieval.

## How Does it Work?

NER systems use machine learning models to tag entities within text. These models are typically trained on annotated corpora and can recognize entities by their context.
