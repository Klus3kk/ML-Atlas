# BERT

## Overview

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model that provides deep contextualized embeddings for words by considering both left and right context in all layers. It significantly improves various NLP tasks through pre-trained contextual embeddings.

## Where is it Used?

- **Question Answering:** Provides contextually relevant answers to questions.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies entities in text with improved accuracy.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Enhances understanding of sentiments in text.

## How Does it Work?

BERT uses a transformer architecture to pre-train embeddings by predicting masked words and the next sentence. Fine-tuning BERT on specific tasks adapts it for various NLP applications.
