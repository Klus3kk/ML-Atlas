# Bag of Words (BoW)

## Overview

Bag of Words (BoW) is a simple and commonly used method for text representation in NLP. It represents text data as a bag of words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping track of the frequency of each word.

## Where is it Used?

- **Text Classification:** Useful for categorizing text into predefined categories.
- **Spam Detection:** Helps in identifying spam emails or messages.
- **Information Retrieval:** Improves search engines and document retrieval systems.

## How Does it Work?

BoW converts text into a vector of word frequencies. Each document is represented by a vector where each dimension corresponds to a word in the vocabulary, and the value is the wordâ€™s frequency in the document.
