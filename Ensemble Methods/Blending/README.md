# Blending

## Overview

Blending is a variation of stacking where the predictions of base models are combined using a simpler method, like weighted averaging, instead of training a meta-model. Itâ€™s typically easier to implement but may not perform as well as stacking.

## Where is it Used?

- **Quick Ensemble Methods:** When you need a simple and fast way to combine models.
- **Practical Scenarios:** Often used in Kaggle competitions where a quick blend of models can improve leaderboard standings.
- **Both Classification and Regression Tasks:** Applicable to various tasks with a focus on simplicity.

## How Does it Work?

In blending, each base model is trained on the training set, and their predictions are averaged (or weighted) to produce the final prediction. Unlike stacking, a separate meta-model is not trained.
