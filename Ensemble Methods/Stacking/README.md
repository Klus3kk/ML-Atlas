# Stacking

## Overview

Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple classification or regression models via a meta-model. The base models are trained on the entire dataset, and a meta-model is trained on their predictions to make the final prediction.

## Where is it Used?

- **Model Blending:** Combining different models, such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.
- **Improving Generalization:** By leveraging the strengths of different models, stacking can improve overall model performance.
- **Both Classification and Regression:** Applicable to various types of tasks.

## How Does it Work?

In stacking, base models are trained on the full dataset, and their predictions are used as inputs for the meta-model. The meta-model learns how to best combine the base models' predictions to produce the final output.
