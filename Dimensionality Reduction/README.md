# Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining as much information as possible. This is essential for simplifying models, reducing computation time, and addressing the curse of dimensionality.

## Subtopics Covered:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)](./LDA/README.md)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Independent Component Analysis (ICA)
