# Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## Overview

Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is both a classification algorithm and a dimensionality reduction technique. It reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto a lower-dimensional space in a way that maximizes class separability.

## Where is it Used?

- **Pattern Recognition:** Improving the performance of classifiers by reducing dimensionality.
- **Feature Extraction:** Selecting features that contribute most to class discrimination.
- **Preprocessing:** Often used before applying a classifier to reduce overfitting.

## How Does it Work?

LDA works by finding a linear combination of features that best separates two or more classes. It maximizes the ratio of between-class variance to within-class variance, ensuring that the classes are as distinct as possible in the lower-dimensional space.
