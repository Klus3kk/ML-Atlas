# Multi-view Learning

## Overview

Multi-view Learning leverages different feature sets or views of the same data to improve learning performance. This technique often involves multiple models trained on different views, which then collaborate to make predictions.

### Where is it Used?

- **Sentiment analysis**: Combining textual data and metadata for better prediction.
- **Medical diagnosis**: Using different diagnostic tests as separate views.

## How Does it Work?

- **Data Partitioning**: Partition the data into different views.
- **Model Training**: Train separate models on each view.
- **Consensus Building**: Combine predictions from each model for final output.
- **Feedback Loop**: Use output from one model to improve the training of another.
