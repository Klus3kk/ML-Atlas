# Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-Supervised Learning is a machine learning approach that lies between supervised and unsupervised learning. It leverages a small amount of labeled data along with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. This method is particularly useful when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming, but large volumes of unlabeled data are readily available.
