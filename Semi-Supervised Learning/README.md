# Supervised Learning
## Overview
Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that sits between supervised and unsupervised learning. It uses a small amount of labeled data along with a larger pool of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, but unlabeled data is abundant.

Semi-supervised learning algorithms leverage the structure in the unlabeled data to provide additional information, enhancing the learning process. This allows models to achieve better generalization by making use of the unlabeled data, which is often closer in distribution to real-world scenarios.
